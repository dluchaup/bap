(* This is needed because we're folding with a hidden and imperative
   table of visited blocks. If sequence will be reevaluated then all
   blocks will be already visited. Of course one can argue that it
   is better to fold with explicit persistent set, but in this case
   I need to write my own loop, since the generator monad doesn't
   allow me to pass my own state with it.*)
